# bed-interview

Here you'll find a small node.js + express.js + backbone.js project that contains:

1. Simple client that allows viewing, adding and editing models 
2. Degenerated node.js server that respects REST api on the `/api/models` 

You need to implement the server side, good luck.

A change in the model should upload new content to s3 bucket bed.interview.rollout.io/&lt;your_name_here&gt;

Off course, I am missing a lot of info that you'll (hopefully) get during the interview
